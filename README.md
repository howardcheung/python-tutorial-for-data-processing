# Introduction

This repository was made to create a tutorial for people to learn basic Python,
Pandas and Matplotlib for data processing. It references several tutorials in
the public place, and they will be clearly addressed if this repository is
going to be used more widely. Everything over here is in draft mode, and
things may be incorrect. So don't read it unless you're clearly instructed
about what they are.
